# Lavalink

## From their Github:

Standalone audio sending node based on Lavaplayer and JDA-Audio. Allows for sending audio without it ever reaching any of your shards.

### What I did

Gave myself the challenge to make an egg for the first time, chose lavalink as I saw someone asking about a server for it. After I made it, I was going to make a PR in the Pterodactyl Egg Repo, only to find that it's already there. 

The exisiting egg requires manual setting of variables to properly download the latest files. Mine does not. Enjoy! 

### Server Ports
Ports required to run the server.


Default port is 2333 however the egg is configured to run the server off of your server's port. 

Mods/Plugins may require ports to be added to the server
